# How the project works
how_it_works: |
  This design generates four different LED patterns based on the selected mode:
  
  Mode 00: Binary Counter - Counts up in binary with 8-bit output
  Mode 01: Knight Rider - Shifting pattern that bounces back and forth
  Mode 02: Pseudo-Random - Uses an 8-bit LFSR with taps at bits 7,5,4,3
  Mode 03: Alternating - Toggles between two complementary patterns (0x55/0xAA)
  
  The design uses a synchronous state machine with an internal counter for timing.
  Pattern updates occur at regular intervals determined by the clock frequency.

# How to test the project
how_to_test: |
  1. Connect 8 LEDs with current-limiting resistors (220Î©) to the output pins
  2. Connect two switches or jumpers to the mode selection pins (inputs 0 and 1)
  3. Apply clock and reset signals
  4. Toggle mode switches to select between the four pattern modes
  5. Observe the LED patterns changing according to the selected mode
